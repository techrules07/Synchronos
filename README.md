# Synchronos

Used MVVM with Retrofit and Live data for Web Request.
Used a broadcast receiver to check whether the service is running
Used a service to trigger a Web request hit every 2 hours.


In Future we could use a notification or widget which keeps refreshing when the web service hit happens.
